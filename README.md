Update the styles in css/styles.css to customize the website's appearance.
In the images folder, replace photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, etc. with your own photos. Add or remove images as needed. Make sure to keep the image file names consistent in the HTML file if you make any changes.
Optionally, modify the js/script.js file to add any desired behavior or interactivity to the website.
